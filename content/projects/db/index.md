# **EssaDB** - Essa Database

{{<cta>}}
**[Repository](https://github.com/essa-software/EssaDB)**

Welcome to ESSA Database Engine! Our goal is to be better than MS Access (which is not that hard). EssaDB is going to have fully implemented SQL dialect (called EssaSQL obviously, right?). We want to be as effective as it's possible, including future great optimizations to Database Engine and our file format being [clever implementation of data heap](https://github.com/essa-software/EssaDB/blob/main/docs/EDBFileFormat.md).
